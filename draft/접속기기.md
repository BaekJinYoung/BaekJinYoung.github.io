Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - jenssegers/agent v1.0.0 requires illuminate/support ~4.0 -> found illuminate/support[v4.0.0, ..., v4.2.17] but these were not loaded, likely because it conflicts with another require.
    - jenssegers/agent[v2.0.0, ..., v2.1.2] require illuminate/support 4.* -> found illuminate/support[v4.0.0, ..., v4.2.17] but these were not loaded, likely because it conflicts with another require.
    - jenssegers/agent[v2.1.3, ..., v2.5.2] require illuminate/support ^4.0|^5.0 -> found illuminate/support[v4.0.0, ..., v4.2.17, v5.0.0, ..., v5.8.36] but these were not loaded, likely because it conflicts with another require.
    - jenssegers/agent[v2.6.0, ..., v2.6.4] require mobiledetect/mobiledetectlib ^2.7.6 -> found mobiledetect/mobiledetectlib[2.7.6, ..., 2.8.45] but the package is fixed to 4.8.06 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - Root composer.json requires jenssegers/agent * -> satisfiable by jenssegers/agent[v1.0.0, v2.0.0, ..., v2.6.4].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.
You can also try re-running composer require with an explicit version constraint, e.g. "composer require jenssegers/agent:*" to figure out if any version is installable, or "composer require jenssegers/agent:^2.1" if you know which you need.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
